This is a slightly edited version of Rama's victory plugin for UE4 with all references to Apex Destruction module removed since it was having issues loading Apex Destruction in packaged games (and I don't need any features related to Apex Destruction).

I recompiled the project in Visual Studio, so now this should be ready to drop into your project's 'plugins' folder.
